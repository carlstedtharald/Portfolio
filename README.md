## 👤 Profile
**Technical Game Designer & Engineering Mathematics Student**

I am a Technical Game Designer with 5+ years of indie development experience, currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Engineering Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology**.

My background combines creative game feel with rigorous mathematical logic. I have previously designed economies for games and used my background in statistics and data analysis to make sure that the systems were fair, engaging, and mathematically sound.

I am passionate about game development while also studying relevant math courses for the job, bridging the gap between creative game design and forming balanced economic systems.
